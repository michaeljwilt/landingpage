                    <h4>Why I became a Developer</h4>
                    <hr>
                    <p>I had always wanted to learn how to code. While working at a hospital, I kept seeing that their
                        software was always out of date and was not easy to use. I knew how it should look and work, but
                        I lacked the programming knowledge to actually understand how to fix it.</p>

                    <p>Then Covid-19 happened. Even in the hospitals, hours were being cut. At first, it wasn't good,
                        but I realized this was the opportune time for me to dive head first into programming.</p>

                    <p>It wasn't easy. I was working more jobs than before to make up my income, with a new wife and
                        baby on the way, but I was determined to learn how to code. It has been a truly tremendous
                        journey. </p>

                    <hr>
                    <p>My first big project was building 2 Python automation programs for a local insurance company,
                        which I just sold. I am also currently building a website for an up and coming podcast network.

                    <hr>
                    <p> To be honest, you've come this far already. But I also have the skills, I'm ready and want to
                        keep learning.</p>
                    <p> My current position in the hospital required I learn how to interpret heart rhythms,
                        dysrythmias, and arrhythmias within 30 days. Now I've been there for 2+ years.</p>
                    <p>What I lack in my short experience, I make up for with my passion and my desire to learn. I
                        really look forward to working with you and your team!</p>
