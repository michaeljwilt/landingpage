                        I was hired to build a data retrieval (automation) program for a local insurance company. After a few weeks, I realized I was in way over my head. I was ready to tell them I had failed, but I gave myself one hour to complete the program. What happened next was like a scene from a movie. I opened my laptop and just jumped into a flow state. Every line of code I tried had worked! After my hour was up, I had built 2 software programs and managed to improve their productivity by 450%!

                    <!-- <p>Then Covid-19 happened. Even in the hospitals, hours were being cut. At first, it wasn't good,
                        but I realized this was the opportune time for me to dive head first into programming.</p>

                    <p>It wasn't easy. I was working more jobs than before to make up my income, with a new wife and
                        baby on the way, but I was determined to learn how to code. It has been a truly tremendous
                        journey. </p> -->

                        When God opens a door into your passion, you jump headfirst. I have spent my entire career in healthcare, 
                        and I have helped save over 70 patient lives in that time. That sounds like a wonderful career, 
                        but there is still more I know I can do. I saw the impact I could have in my hospital, 
                        using data, and I didn't even know it. Now, as a Data Scientist, I can take that and make an even bigger impact. 
                        Wherever I go, I will be using data to improve as many lives as possible. The possibilities are endless for 
                        the impact we can have on this world. God gave me a passion and the skills to be a Data Scientist, 
                        and now I'm ready to get to work!</p>
